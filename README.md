# Debricking VAG 5Q0 PLA3.0
This is a story about trying to debrick a PLA3.0 module



When I tried to flash the 5Q0 (MQB) module with the 7N0 (PQ) firmware, it gave me the silent treatment and left me with zero communication

This repository describes the attempt to bring it back to life (still ongoing!).

## Watchdog

MCU is powered via LDO Regulator (NCV4263-2C) with Watchdog. WD is reseted by rising edge from pin 10 of MCU, so it's need to be bypassed for JTAG access. According to the datasheet, to disable WD pin 5 (DelayTiming) needs to be lifted (NC). (If you have a better idea, please contact me, as I don't have much experience in this type of thing)

## Overview 

- Module P/N: 5Q0 919 298 C, H08
- MCU used: SPC56AP60L3 (LQFP100, 1 MB Flash)
- [Datasheet](https://www.st.com/en/automotive-microcontrollers/spc56ap60l3.html)

The most important question right now is whether the JTAG interface is unlocked. I havenâ€™t checked that yet.
